# Is It Even?

This Java program "efficiently" checks whether the numbers from 1 to 1000 are odd or even â€” by generating and printing 1000 individual if/else statements.

## What It Does

Instead of looping through numbers and checking them in a typical way, this program uses a for loop to generate source code with 1000 manually written conditional checks.

Example Output:

    if (1 % 2 == 0) {

    System.out.println("1 is even");

    } else {

    System.out.println("1 is odd");
    
    }

...and so on until 1000.

## How to Run

Compile and run the Java program:

`javac evenOdd.java`

`java evenOdd`

The program will print 1000 Java if/else statements to the console, one for each number.
